# Power Generation Using Hybrid Force-Driven Vertical Axis Wind Turbine

## 📖 Project Overview
This project addresses the efficiency limitations of conventional Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs). Standard VAWTs typically struggle with either low rotational speed (Savonius type) or the inability to self-start (Darrieus type).

**The Solution: A Hybrid Rotor Design**
We designed and analyzed a **Hybrid VAWT** that integrates two distinct aerodynamic mechanisms into a single system:
* **Drag-Based Force (Savonius Rotor):** Located at the center, this rotor provides high starting torque, enabling the turbine to self-start even in low wind conditions.
* **Lift-Based Force (Darrieus Rotor):** Located on the exterior, these aerofoil blades utilize lift forces to achieve high RPM and power efficiency once the turbine is in motion.

By combining these technologies, this prototype overcomes the "dead band" of static friction while maintaining the high-speed efficiency required for effective power generation. The system is designed for omnidirectional wind capture, making it ideal for decentralized urban energy applications.
